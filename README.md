# Hi, I'm Cori! :woman_technologist:

## tl;dr:

I like to nerd out about algorithms and new ideas. :bulb: I love data, debugging, and thoughtful processes. :bar_chart: My background is in classical music. :violin: I care about people :busts_in_silhouette: and tech that makes a positive impact. :muscle:

## What I'm up to now:

* Software engineering at [Loop](https://www.loopreturns.com/)!
* Advocating for artists in the tech world with [Artists Who Code](https://linktr.ee/artistswhocode).
* Speaking, volunteering, and attending conferences such as Longhorn PHP and php[tek].
