# Hi, I'm Cori! :woman_technologist:

## tl;dr:

I came to tech by way of classical music, which means I care deeply about technical craft, how people work in harmony, and how practice makes ~~perfect~~ progress. Whether I'm designing backend systems, writing developer docs, or giving a talk on soft skills, my work is rooted in creativity and care.
