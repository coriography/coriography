# Hi, I'm Cori! :woman_technologist:

## tl;dr:

I like to nerd out about algorithms and new ideas. :bulb: I love data, debugging, and thoughtful processes. :bar_chart: My background is in classical music. :violin: I care about people :busts_in_silhouette: and tech that makes a positive impact. :muscle:

## What I'm up to now:

* Joining my new team at [Ovia Health](https://www.oviahealth.com/) in July 2021 as a backend engineer.
* Working toward deploying my favorite project, [Cello Tree](https://github.com/coriography/cello_tree).
* Building a personal portfolio website in React.
* Co-directing Mentorship and leading Algorithms Study Group at [Artists Who Code](https://www.linkedin.com/company/artistswhocode/).
