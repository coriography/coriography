# Hi, I'm Cori! :woman_technologist:

## tl;dr:

I like to nerd out about algorithms and new ideas. :bulb: I love data, debugging, and thoughtful processes. :bar_chart: My background is in classical music. :violin: I care about people :busts_in_silhouette: and tech that makes a positive impact. :muscle:

## What I'm up to now:

* Contributing to [Ovia Health's](https://www.oviahealth.com/) apps for fertility, pregnancy, and parenting as a backend engineer.
* Gaining proficiency in PHP and SQL. 
* Reading [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/).
* Working toward deploying my personal portfolio website and blog, built with React.
* Co-directing the Mentorship program at [Artists Who Code](https://www.linkedin.com/company/artistswhocode/).
