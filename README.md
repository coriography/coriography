# Hi, I'm Cori! :woman_technologist:

## tl;dr:

I like to nerd out about algorithms and new ideas. :bulb: I love data, debugging, and thoughtful processes. :bar_chart: My background is in classical music. :violin: I care about people :busts_in_silhouette: and tech that makes a positive impact. :muscle:

## What I'm up to now:

* Backend engineering at [Ovia Health](https://www.oviahealth.com/), supporting [apps for fertility, pregnancy, and parenting](https://info.oviahealth.com/enroll).
* Advocating for artists in the tech world as Director of [Artists Who Code](https://linktr.ee/artistswhocode).
* Keeping my frontend skills fresh with personal projects and mentorship in CSS and JavaScript/React.
