# Thanks for checking out my GitHub!

## tl;dr:

* I like to nerd out about algorithms and new ideas. :bulb:
* I love data, debugging, and thoughtful processes. :bar_chart:
* My background is in classical music. :violin:
* I care about people. :busts_in_silhouette:
* I care about tech that makes a positive impact. :muscle:

## What's happening lately?

* I'm improving my Python :snake: by studying data structures and algorithms (dictionaries are my favorite!).
* I'm working toward deploying my favorite project, [Cello Tree](https://github.com/coriography/cello_tree).
* I'm building a personal portfolio website in React.
* At [Artists Who Code](https://www.linkedin.com/company/artistswhocode/), I'm editor of the blog (coming soon) and leader of the algorithms study group.
